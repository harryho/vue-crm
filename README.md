# Vue CRM

> A reusable Vue.js CRM starter project for real-world business based on Vue 2 PWA template with Vuetify.

The goal of this project is to create a reusable starter project for real-world business. To achieve this target, we need a solution which includes simple authentication process, restful API with token support and simple but elegant UI design.


#### Features

* This project is built from Vue 2 PWA template by default.
* The UI part is built on the top of Vuetify.
* It inlcudes Vuex and Axios to manage authentication. (Dummy token)
* The token and user profile is managed by Vue-Persisteddstate.
* The dashboard uses vue-chartjs to create charts on dashboard.
* The starter project has integrated progress bar.
* ~~To simulate real-world business, this starter project chooses Json-Server as fake Restful API. (You can simple replace it with your own API).~~
* Fake API is just readonly fake service.
* CRUD functions for Customer, Order and Product


### Live Demo

[Demo App](https://vue-app-demo.harryho.org):  The demo is just a proof of concept. It doesn't have back-end API and all features of master branch.

#### Screenshots ( The actual UI will be slightly different because I am lazy to keep up to date :p )

docker run -p 8080:80 -v \
$(pwd)/dist:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:alpine


# Build release image
docker build . -t  vc-prd

#### Alternatives

There are two similar projects respectively built on the Angular and React. If you have interests in those technical stacks. You can find and clone those repositories below.

* [Ng-MD-App](https://github.com/harryho/ng-md-app.git).
* [React-Crm](https://github.com/harryho/react-crm.git).
* [Ng4Crm](https://github.com/harryho/ng4crm.git). (This is no longer maintained with latest Angular)


#### Change log

* Rebase demo branch to master

  New master doesn't rely on Json-Server as fake API. It will only have Readonly fake API. It means any new or updated data will be stored to any physical file. All test data will be rolled back after system restart.

* Create an archived branch json-server

  This branch was the master which used Json-Server as fake API. Considering the hiccup of setting Json-Server up and maintenance, it will be replaced by fake service ( Readonly fake API). You still can find clone this branch by branch name __json-server__, but it will be no longer updated. It is an archived branch.
